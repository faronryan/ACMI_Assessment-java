# ACMI_Assessment-java

Project was built in an NetBeans 8.2 IDE. Best to open in IDE and run tests to demonstrate the module is functional.

Assessments completed:

1. Dotted quad netmask to CIDR Bits
2. Find some MAC Address
3. Nested Hash Constructor
4. Change delta object

Note: I choose to use NetBeans 8.2(another flavor eclipse) because it has a really nice test suite integration. Right click any function and generate test suite, case, code stubs, etc.
